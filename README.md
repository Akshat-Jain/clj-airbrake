# clj-hoptoad

Clojure client for the [Hoptoad API](http://hoptoadapp.com/pages/home).

## Usage

    (reqire '[clj-hoptoad.core :as hoptoad])

    (def request {:url "http://example.com" :component "foo" :action "bar"
                 :cgi-data {"SERVER_NAME" "nginx", "HTTP_USER_AGENT" "Mozilla"}
                 :params {"city" "LA", "state" "CA"}
                 :session {"user-id" "23"}})

    (def exception (try (throw (Exception. "Foo")) (catch Exception e e)) ; throw to get a stacktrace

    (hoptoad/notify "my-api-key" "production" "/app/dir" exception request)
    => {:error-id 42 :id 100 :url "http://sub.hoptoadapp.com/errors/42/notices/100"}

Note that the `request` is one-to-one with Hoptoad's API and *not* a [Ring][ring] request. (Providing a mapper function is on the TODO list.)

The `request` is optional but is the only way the Hoptoad API allows you to pass in additonal information.
So, if you are using the client out of the context of a web application you can use the request to send in
enviromental variables or anything else that may help in troubleshooting.  Note, that `url` in the request is required if you do provide a `request` hashmap.

## TODO

 * Provide mapper function for [Ring][ring] requests.
 * [Ring][ring] middleware to at least serve as an example.
 * Param filtering. (i.e. automatically filter out any 'password' params)
 * Allow for certain environments to be ignored... defaulting to `#{"test" "development"}`
 * Configuartion management?  i.e. set api-key once
